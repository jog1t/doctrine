# Doctrine — Architecture

## Overview

Doctrine is a strategy game where players write instruction systems (doctrine) that govern autonomous AI agents. This document describes the technical architecture for the prototype (Milestone 1).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Backend actors | [RivetKit](https://rivet.dev) | Stateful actors with real-time WebSocket communication |
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite | UI for map visualization, doctrine editing, tick debrief |
| Shared types | TypeScript | Type-safe contract between server and client |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces | `server/`, `client/`, `shared/` packages |

## Architecture Decisions

### Single Actor Model (Milestone 1)

The `gameWorld` actor owns all game state for a session. This is intentionally simple for the prototype. Future milestones will split into:
- Per-agent actors (when memory tiers are introduced in M2)
- Map chunk actors (when shared map / PvP is introduced in M3)
- Matchmaking actor (M9)

### Doctrine as JSON

Milestone 1 uses raw JSON for doctrine authoring. This validates the core loop before investing in a richer editor. The `Doctrine` type in `shared/` is the schema contract.

### Client-Driven Tick Loop

Auto-tick is driven by `setInterval` on the client calling `executeTick()` via RPC. This is simple and correct for single-player. Server-driven ticks will be needed for multiplayer (M9).

### Deterministic Agents (Tier 0)

All agent logic is pure functions of `(agent, doctrine, map, tick) -> action`. No randomness, no memory. This is the "stateless" baseline from the design doc. Agents will gain memory in M2.

## Key Patterns

### State Flow
```
Player edits doctrine JSON
  -> deployDoctrine() RPC
  -> Actor updates state
  -> broadcast("doctrineDeployed")

Player clicks TICK (or auto-tick fires)
  -> executeTick() RPC
  -> Engine runs all agents deterministically
  -> Actions applied to mutable state
  -> Debrief generated
  -> broadcast("tickCompleted")
  -> React re-renders map + debrief
```

### Agent Decision Priority
- **Gatherer**: deposit if full -> gather if on resource -> move to nearest resource -> idle
- **Scout**: patrol pattern based on doctrine config -> linger at position -> move
- **Defender**: return to guard radius if too far -> hold position

## Guardrails for Future Work

1. **All game state lives in actors** — no client-side game state beyond UI concerns
2. **Types are the contract** — `shared/` types must be updated before server or client changes
3. **Agent logic is pure** — `executeAgent()` takes inputs, returns actions. No side effects.
4. **Actions are applied separately** — decision and mutation are distinct phases (important for replay in M8)
5. **Doctrine is versioned** — every deploy increments version. Agents carry their deploy version (Fog of Self, M6)
6. **Map generation is seeded** — same seed = same map, always (important for replay)
7. **Events, not polling** — use RivetKit broadcast/events for all state updates to clients
